    <div class="post">
      <p>Since its inception, SPDY has depended on a TLS extension called <a href="https://technotes.googlecode.com/git/nextprotoneg.html">NPN</a>. NPN allows a TLS connection to negotiate which application-level protocol will be running across it.</p>

<p>NPN allows SPDY to be enabled efficiently. If we had run SPDY on a 
different port, then we would have had to be constantly creating probing
 connections to see whether a site supported SPDY as well as HTTPS. Even
 if we knew that a site supported SPDY, network devices between any 
given client and that site might block connections to the different TCP 
port. If we had tried an HTTP Upgrade header, that would have slowed 
everything down and caused compatibility issues with servers and proxies
 that didn't process the header correctly.</p>

<p>NPN also allows us to update SPDY without spending round trips on a 
version negotiation. Overall, NPN has worked very well for SPDY.</p>

<p>NPN attempted to be a little bit future proof by sending the selected
 application protocol name under encryption, so that network devices 
couldn't discriminate. The benefit was somewhat limited because the 
server's list of supported protocols was still sent in the clear but we 
believe that anything that can be encrypted, should be encrypted.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to NPN: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-friedl-tls-applayerprotoneg-02">ALPN</a> is essentially the same design except that the negotiation is done in the clear (like other TLS extensions).</p>

<p>Last Friday, at IETF 86 in Orlando, the TLS working group considered 
both designs and came to a rough consensus on ALPN. ALPN is currently on
 track to be published as an RFC at some point and we will be switching 
SPDY over to it and deprecating NPN.</p>

<p>Once IANA has assigned a TLS extension number for ALPN, Google servers will start supporting <i>both</i>
 NPN and ALPN, with a preference for ALPN. Chrome and, I expect, other 
browsers will start sending both NPN and ALPN extensions. During this 
time, SPDY servers will be able to switch from NPN to ALPN without 
dropping SPDY support for current clients.</p>

<p>At some point after the end of 2014, I plan on removing NPN support 
from Chrome and Google servers. Any old servers and clients will 
continue to function just fine: they'll just use HTTPS.</p>
